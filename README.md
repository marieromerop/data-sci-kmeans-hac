# data-sci-kmeans-hac

Hello, 

The purpose of this repository is solely for resume purposes-- to display the work i have completed in Data Science through my previous courses. These particular files show my work with K-Means and Hierarchical Aggregate Clustering-- two different clustering methods that are widely used in the domain of Data Science. I use the Elbow method to generate how many clusters will be used in the k-means method. Please make sure you either use jupyter notebook or google colab to view the .ipynb files. Also, make sure the data(1).csv file is saved int eh same working directory as the .ipynb file-- otherwise you will run into an error when reading the file in using pandas.
